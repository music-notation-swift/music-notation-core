/// A structure that describes a music notation time signature.
///
/// A time signature (also known as meter signature,[1] metre signature,[2] and measure signature)[3]
/// is a convention in Western music notation that specifies how many note values of a particular type
/// are contained in each measure (bar). The time signature indicates the meter of a musical movement
/// at the bar level.
///
/// In a music score the time signature appears as two stacked numerals, such as 4/4 (spoken as fourâ€“four time),
/// or a time symbol, such as common time (spoken as common time). It immediately follows the key signature
/// (or if there is no key signature, the clef symbol). A mid-score time signature, usually immediately
/// following a barline, indicates a change of meter.
///
/// Most time signatures are either simple (the note values are grouped in pairs, like 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4),
/// or compound (grouped in threes, like 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8). Less common signatures indicate complex,
/// mixed, additive, and irrational meters.

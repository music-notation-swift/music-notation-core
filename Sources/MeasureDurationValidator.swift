	/// measure when it is checked.

	///		dictionary of notes that will fit. It gives the smallest number of notes possible to fill.

	/// - overfilled: The measure has too many notes to be complete. The `overflowingNotes` associated value will give the range
	/// of notes that would need to be removed for the measure to not be full anymore. Note that if the range of notes
	/// is removed, it could be `full` or `notFull` depending on how large the last note removed was.

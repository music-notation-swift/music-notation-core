/// This represents a measure that is part of a repeat. This is not one of the original measures that
/// will be repeated. This represents a measure that is a repeat of one of the original measures to
/// be repeated.
///
/// i.e. If we want to repeat measure A 2 times, you would have
///
///    | A, repeated A, repeated A |
///
/// This structure represents those repeated measures "repeated A", so that they can be differentiated from the
/// original measure "A".

/// - Note: Look at `MeasureRepeat.expand()` to see how this is used.

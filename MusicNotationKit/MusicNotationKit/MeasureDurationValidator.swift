 This is a collection of static functions that will give information about the completeness of the duration of a 
 `Measure`. A measure must have a certain number of notes according to its `TimeSignature` in order to be valid.
 `MeasureDurationValidator` provides information as to the validitiy of the measure and any information that can be used
 in order to be able to modify the measure so that it can be made valid.

     This represents the state of a measure's duration. It represents whether the `Measure` is full, notFull,
     overfilled, or somehow invalid. The fullness is dictated by the time signature and how many notes are in the
     measure when it is checked.
     
     - notFull: The measure doesn't have all the notes needed to be full. The `availableNotes` associated value will give a
        dictionary of notes that will fit. It gives the smallest number of notes possible to fill.
     - full: The measure is complete and cannot hold any more or less notes.
     - overfilled: The measure has too many notes to be complete. The `overflowingNotes` associated value will give the range
     of notes that would need to be removed for the measure to not be full anymore. Note that if the range of notes
     is removed, it could be `full` or `notFull` depending on how large the last note removed was.
